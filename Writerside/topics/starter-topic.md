## Upgrading

If you want to try out this project, I suggest to install all dependencies from `composer.lock` file and then follow
`General setup documentation` to set up and have all up and running
<tabs>
    <tab title="Install from lock">
        <code-block lang="bash">composer install</code-block>
    </tab>
</tabs>

However, if you wish to setup project and upgrade everything, I suggest you to make a copy of the project and go step by step, upgrading single dependency at the time.

- For PHP check [PHP Watch](https://php.watch/versions)
- For possible Slim upgrade, check [SlimPHP Docs (Upgrade Guide)](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/start/upgrade.html)
- For all others dependencies, check `packagist` or official git repo
